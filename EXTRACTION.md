# Extraction decisions

## Dependency closure

The closure was derived from `cargo metadata --locked --format-version 1` at upstream commit
`2fd6e237787fd808d3b934b7ddfc428daac79ea8`, classifying normal, build, dev, target-specific, and
feature-gated dependencies separately. Starting packages were `gpui` and `gpui_platform`; all four
platform implementations and their renderer were retained so the manifests remain portable.

The resulting internal runtime/build closure is the crate list in `UPSTREAM.md`. `collections`,
`http_client`, `media`, `refineable`, `scheduler`, and `sum_tree` are included because GPUI or a
platform implementation uses them directly. `derive_refineable` is required by `refineable`.

`gpui_tokio` is an optional adapter rather than a GPUI runtime requirement, but is included because
this extraction tracks the complete upstream `gpui_*` crate family. Zed editor, UI component,
cloud, collaboration, telemetry, project, workspace, and language crates are outside the closure.
Upstream examples, integration tests, and benchmarks were excluded; unit tests embedded in the
retained source are preserved.

## Workspace reconstruction

The root manifest uses resolver 2 and contains only extracted members plus the hello-world package.
Workspace dependency declarations were copied from the upstream manifest with their exact version,
feature, git revision, and target settings. Internal dependencies are local paths. Only the
`async-task` and `calloop` upstream patches needed by this closure were retained. Zed application
profiles and release metadata were omitted because they do not affect GPUI correctness.

The upstream Rust version was retained, while Zed-only targets and rustflags were removed. This
prevents an ordinary host build from requiring unrelated cross-compilation targets.

## Decoupling

- `sum_tree -> ztracing` was replaced by the Apache/MIT `tracing` attribute macro. Attribute use is
  unchanged (`#[instrument(skip_all)]`), so the public API did not change.
- The `zlog` dev dependency and its test initializer were removed.
- GPUI's three performance-marked unit tests are ordinary `#[test]` functions here. This removes
  `util_macros -> perf`, which is Zed test tooling and not runtime functionality.
- The optional `http_client` GitHub-download feature and its Zed `util` dependency were removed.
- Upstream example and benchmark target declarations were removed. No GPUI public API was changed.

## Platform dependencies and assets

macOS retains Metal, Core Graphics/Text, Cocoa, AccessKit, media bindings, and the pinned Zed font-kit
fork. Linux/FreeBSD retains Wayland, X11, WGPU, AccessKit Unix, portal, clipboard, and text-system
dependencies. Windows retains DirectX/DirectWrite, Win32, AccessKit Windows, and manifest support.
Web retains its WASM platform implementation.

The updated platform crates retain GPUI's system-notification implementations through
`notify-rust` on Linux/FreeBSD, UserNotifications on macOS, and WinRT notifications on Windows.

GPUI embeds IBM Plex Sans and Lilex fonts for SVG/Web fallback rendering. Only those required font
families were copied; their upstream license files are retained beside them.
The JPEG used by GPUI's EXIF-orientation unit test is retained under `crates/gpui/tests/fixtures`;
its bytes originate from upstream commit `9552acc2bc242d45342fa9b5a987d43868aee1ec`.

## License review

The GPUI/platform crates and the non-GPUI internal dependencies in the retained closure declare
Apache-2.0 upstream, except `gpui_shared_string` and `gpui_util`, whose manifests declare no license.
Those two crates were included only after explicit user direction; their ambiguity is not resolved
or represented as legal advice. The GPL-only `ztracing` and `zlog` crates are not included.

The IBM Plex Sans and Lilex directories include their respective license texts. Microsoft-derived
shader sections retain their source copyright notices. See `NOTICE`.

## Reproducibility and known gaps

The extraction is a traceable source copy plus the small edits listed above. To evaluate a later Zed
revision, run `scripts/check-upstream.sh`, review the reported manifests/source/assets, recompute
metadata in the upstream checkout, and apply changes manually.

Validation was performed on macOS (`aarch64-apple-darwin`). Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, and WASM were
not cross-compiled because their targets/system packages were not installed automatically. GUI
launch was not used as an automated assertion; the hello-world binary was compile-checked.
